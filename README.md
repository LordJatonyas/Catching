# Catching
A MATLAB implementation of a 2-player catching game. The game involves 2 players (the Player and the Catcher) and food items randomly strewn across the map. 

## How To Play?
The Player uses WASD keys to control movement while the Catcher uses the arrow keys. The Player cannot go out of bounds, but the Catcher can, which may inspire some crafty strategies. The Player's goal is to collect as many food items as possible without getting caught by the Catcher. When caught or if the Player exits the playing area, a messagebox appears indicating the Player's score (number of food items collected).

To run the game, you need to have access to the MATLAB GUI. Open this repo on it and run:
